## Recommended Frameworks

### React
We recommend using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for 'big build like' Single Page Applications (SPA's). React is suited for long term projects that need stable and maintainable code. React works great together with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

##### Getting started
Start a new React project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Vue
We recommend using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for 'campaign like'  Single Page Applications (SPA's). Vue is suited for projects that needs complex interaction, flexibility and fast development.

##### Getting Started
Start a new Vue project with [Vue Skeleton](https://github.com/hjeti/vue-skeleton).

### Muban
We recommend using [Muban](https://github.com/mediamonks/muban) for Server Rendered Websites. Muban makes integration into CMS systems, like [AEM](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/experience-manager.html), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com/) and [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/) easier.

##### Getting Started
Start a new Muban project with the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/mediamonks/muban#-quick-start).
