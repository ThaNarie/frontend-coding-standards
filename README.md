## Definition of Done Checklist

#### Before Starting feature
- [x] Read the ticket. If no ticket is present, create one yourself or ask the Project Manager to create one.
- [x] Make sure the ticket is clear and actionable. If not, reassign the ticket to the person responsible for the creation of the tickets (the project manager or project lead) until the ticket is 100% clear.
- [x] Create a feature branch (`feature/ticket-number-feature-name` or for Jira use the default branch name when creating a branch from a ticket)
